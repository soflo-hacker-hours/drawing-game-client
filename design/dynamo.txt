Room ID = G
Player Cookies = A, B, C

Order = 0
(G,"S")
Status = Lobby
Players = 0

Player B submits name to room G.
(G,B)
Expires = sometime
Order = 1
Name = "B"
(G,"S")
Status = Lobby
Players = 1

Player C submits name to room G.
(G,C)
Expires = sometime
Order = 2
Name = "C"
(G,"S")
Status = Lobby
Players = 2

Player A submits name to room G.
(G,A)
Expires = sometime
Order = 0
Name = "A"
(G,"S")
Status = RoundOdd
Players = 3
Round = 1

Player A submits text.
(G,1_A_A)
Name = "A"
